    <h2>Making the Site</h2>
    <p>I wanted to created a top down shooter. It was suppose to a game where the player <br>
    Sees how many points they can get before they die.</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>In my proposal, I wanted to the player to move around and collect batteries to <br>
    to recharge their suit. However due to time constraints, I was unable to make that. Instead <br>
    I choose to make it so that the player is unable to move. They must defend themselves from the<br>
    Aliens that are coming towards them. If enough of them gets to the player, it's game over</p>
    <p>
    The characters were drawn by me while the background was photoshoped.Most of the times was spent<br>
    trying to figure out how to get the character to spin with the mouse.
